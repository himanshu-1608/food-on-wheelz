## Hola People,
Another app made by me which is generally taken as one of the starting apps by developers - The Food Ordering App.
It cotains list of hotels from which you can order any food item(quantity fixed to 1 per item for now, I don't want you to get fat :p).
Just tap on any hotel, select items you wanna eat & place the order. Order history is also handled by API.
